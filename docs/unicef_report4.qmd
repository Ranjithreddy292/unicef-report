## Executive Summary

This report explores key indicators from UNICEF's global dataset with an emphasis on data storytelling and interactive visualization principles. We uncover patterns that may influence global child well-being and recommend future research directions.

---

## Goal

To visually analyze UNICEF's global dataset using various exploratory plots, identify patterns across regions and demographics, and build a foundation for actionable insights aiding UNICEF’s mission.

---

## Introduction

Children's well-being across the globe depends on multiple dynamic factors including education, health, and social equality. Using the UNICEF dataset, this analysis aims to visually represent different indicators to better understand global disparities and trends.


---

## Data Preview

A preview of the dataset used in this analysis:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("unicef_indicator_cleaned.csv")
df.head()
```

---

## World Map: Visualizing Current Age by Country


This map shows the average current age of children across different countries, revealing demographic patterns worldwide.

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

shapefile_path = r'C:\Users\satya\OneDrive\Desktop\quarto_unicef_report\ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp'
world = gpd.read_file(shapefile_path)

# Merge with the dataset
map_data = world.merge(df, left_on='ADMIN', right_on='country')

# Plot: Using 'current_age'
ax = map_data.plot(column='current_age', cmap='viridis', legend=True, figsize=(12, 9), edgecolor='black')
ax.set_title('Average Current Age by Country', fontsize=16)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()

```
This world map displays the average current age of children across different countries. By visualizing demographic patterns geographically, we can quickly spot regions with younger or older child populations. Such insights help UNICEF and policymakers tailor age-specific interventions and allocate resources more effectively.

## Time Series: Sex Differences in Selected Countries

This time series tracks the indicator value split by sex across selected countries over time.

```{python}
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_line, labs, theme_light, facet_wrap

df['time_period'] = pd.to_datetime(df['time_period'], errors='coerce')

(
    ggplot(df[df['country'].isin(['India', 'Brazil', 'Kenya'])], aes('time_period', 'obs_value', color='sex')) +
    geom_line(size=1.2) +
    labs(title='Time Trend by Sex in Selected Countries', x='Year', y='Indicator Value') +
    facet_wrap('country') +
    theme_light()
)


```
The time series plot tracks changes in the indicator values over time, split by sex (male, female) for selected countries (India, Brazil, and Kenya). Observing these trends helps highlight gender-based disparities and understand how different policies, social structures, or crises impact boys and girls differently over the years.

---

## Scatter Plot: Current Age vs Time Period (Trend)

This scatter plot examines the relationship between current age and year, with a regression line to spot any aging trends over time.

```{python}
from plotnine import geom_point, geom_smooth

# Drop missing values
plot_df = df.dropna(subset=['current_age', 'time_period'])

plot = (
    ggplot(plot_df, aes('time_period', 'current_age')) +
    geom_point(alpha=0.5, color='blue') +
    geom_smooth(method='lm', color='red') +
    labs(title='Current Age over Time', x='Year', y='Current Age') +
    theme_light()
)

plot




```
This scatter plot investigates whether the current age of observed children shows any trend over different years. The added regression line indicates if there is a statistically noticeable shift — for example, whether reported ages are getting younger or older over time, hinting at possible demographic shifts or changes in survey methodologies.

---
## Bar Chart: Observation Status across Countries

A bar chart summarizing the count of different observation statuses for the top 10 countries in the dataset.

```{python}
# Prepare data
from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_bar, labs, theme_light, theme, element_text

bar_data = df['country'].value_counts().head(10).reset_index()
bar_data.columns = ['country', 'count']

(
    ggplot(bar_data, aes('country', 'count', fill='country')) +
    geom_bar(stat='identity') +
    labs(title='Top 10 Countries by Observation Count', x='Country', y='Count') +
    theme_light() +
    theme(axis_text_x=element_text(rotation=45, hjust=1))
)

```

The bar chart summarizes the number of recorded observations (by observation status) for the top 10 countries. This visualization helps identify countries with stronger data reporting practices and potential biases in data collection. It also points out where UNICEF’s future data efforts could be concentrated to ensure comprehensive and equitable reporting.

## Conclusion

Through this visual journey, we observe notable regional disparities, gender differences, and temporal patterns. Such analysis can guide UNICEF initiatives by pinpointing where interventions are most urgently needed.

---

## Future Work
- Explore deeper indicator relationships using multivariate analysis.

- Integrate external datasets (e.g., GDP, education rates) for richer context.

- Develop predictive models to forecast child well-being indicators.
